## Text Classification With Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) without embedding layers
This repository contains the code for text classification using a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) without embedding layers. The repository involves tokenizing text data, converting it into sequences, and training a simple neural network model to classify the text.

## Description
The goal of this task is to perform text classification using a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN). The model is trained on a small dataset of text samples, where each sample is labeled as either positive (1) or negative (0). The text data is tokenized and converted into sequences, which are then padded to ensure uniform input size. The FFNN model is built using Keras and consists of two dense layers with ReLU and sigmoid activations, respectively.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
To run this code, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- scikit-learn
- keras
- tensorflow
