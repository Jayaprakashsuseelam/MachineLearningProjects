# PIMA Diabetes Analysis

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the **PIMA Diabetes Dataset** using Python and data science techniques. The project explores key features, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applies machine learning models to predict diabetes occurrences.

## Project Overview

The PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset is widely used in machine learning and healthcare analytics. This analysis includes:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
- Performance metrics and visualization

## Dataset

The dataset consists of several health-related variables for PIMA Indian women, including:
- Number of pregnancies
- Glucose levels
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Insulin levels
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Age
- Outcome (diabetes presence: 1 = Yes, 0 = No)
