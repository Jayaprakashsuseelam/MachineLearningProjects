# Fine-tuning BERT for Multi-label Text Classification

This repository contains code for fine-tuning BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and similar transformer-based models for multi-label text classification tasks. The implementation is based on the Hugging Face `transformers` library and utilizes PyTorch for deep learning.

## Features
- Fine-tuning BERT (and other transformer models) for multi-label classification.
- Support for datasets with multiple label assignments per text instance.
- Utilizes Hugging Face's `transformers` library.
- Implements data preprocessing and tokenization using `AutoTokenizer`.
- Includes model evaluation metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and loss tracking.
- GPU-accelerated training with PyTorch.

## Dataset Reference
The dataset used for training and evaluation should be in CSV format with the following columns:
- `text`: The textual content to be classified.
- `labels`: Corresponding multi-labels encoded as binary vectors or categorical representations.

Example:
| text | labels |
|----------------------|----------------|
| "Sample text here"  | [1, 0, 1, 0]  |

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install torch transformers datasets scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage
### Training the Model
Run the training script:
```bash
python train.py --dataset_path dataset.csv --model_name bert-base-uncased
```

### Evaluating the Model
```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path saved_model --test_data test.csv
```

## Model Fine-Tuning Approach
- Load pre-trained BERT model from Hugging Face.
- Modify output layers for multi-label classification.
- Train with a binary cross-entropy loss function.
- Use AdamW optimizer and learning rate scheduling.

## Results and Performance
Results include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score computed on a test dataset.
